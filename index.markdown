### Problem statement

Currently, our understanding of UAP/UFO phenomena relies on slow-drip leaks, incomplete low-quality videos from questionable sources, and information of unknown integrity. The truth has been disproportionately restricted to the chosen few for too long.

 

### The proposal

If the UAP/UFO phenomon is as prevalent as many believe, we should be able to collect our own data. Let’s switch the focus to collecting high quality images, video, and other data ourselves. Let’s make this data available to all.

Instead of waiting for the next leak or spending time analyizing random posts, let’s go out and find these things.

A change in mindset is needed to switch to a proactive search, transparently sharing all data collected. This site aims to serve as a reference for some practical tips, as well as publishing any submitted reports.

A proactive search could be as simple as getting in your truck with a buddy and staking out a known UFO hotspot.

UAPHunters.net is designed to be fully open source and transparent. The code for this site is on GitHub, and anyone is free to contribute to the project and suggest changes [here](https://github.com/UAPHunters/uaphunters-web).

 

### Methodology

As a sort of “data-collection charter”, here are some ideas and best practices

- Where possible, have more than one camera recording
- More than one person, ideally - multiple witness statements can really help


#### Examples of other devices

- Night vision cameras
- Infra red cameras
- Heat detection cameras
- Drones
- Drones with “bait”
- Dashcams or Bodycams always recording could be very helpful


A variety of sensors is encouraged so we can correlate and corroborate the data. By combining multiple video/data sources, we can help verify the collected videos are real.

#### Device settings

Enable all metadata properties on your cameras.
Enable GPS if available.
Make sure the date/time on your devices is set correctly.
 

### Data sharing

All original files will be made available for free via this project. The original files will not be modified in any way, simply shared so that anyone interested can scrutinize the originals.

The original source of the media will retain all rights, and is free to share them on other social media, news, etc. The key here is that the original files will be available, with all original metadata intact.

 

### Submitting a report

Submit a report by following the simple process below.

1. Collect all the data from your report so it’s ready to go
1. Include a “field report” or “submission statement” with the files. A simple text file is fine. Include as much detail as you can about your experience. Where you went. The timings.
1. Upload the files to Dropbox or something similar
1. Email the link to the files to [reports@uaphunters.net](mailto:reports@uaphunters.net)


Reports will be validated for spam/abuse/etc and then uploaded to a public S3 Bucket. At which point a link to the data will be posted on this site. In the interests of transparency, any rejected reports will be logged on a page here, including the reason for rejection and any supporting evidence.
